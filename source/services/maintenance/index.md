## Operation and Product Alerts

Staying current about RiverSync alerts regarding operation recommendations, device updates, and software updates can be challenging. RiverSync Maintenance Services helps preempt infrastructure disruption by allowing you to identify and manage relevant alerts for your devices. It proactively identifies which devices are effected by RiverSync published product alerts and operation advisories and enables you to document alert-related activity. For example, you can flag a device for immediate action, ignore an alert for a device, or enter status information for future reference.

- Hardware alerts: Hardware alerts inform you about devices that have reached or are approaching end of life in your infrastructure.
- Software alerts: Software alerts inform you about end-of-life issues with specific software versions you are using.
- Field notices: Field notices inform you about significant issues with a hardware device or software version. A field notice often requires customer action.

An alert management workflow help you more efficiently manage alerts by allowing you to assign status information to alerts. It then filters future alerts so that you receive only those that still require your attention. For example, an alert can be closed, or its status can be changed to “action taken”. In either case, you will not be distracted by that alert in the future. Alert status information also makes it easy for supervisors to monitor their team’s progress toward desired goals as the work on reviewing alerts and performing the required actions.

## Product Lifecycle Management

Maintaining up-to-date installed base data in RiverSync Maintenance Services can provide dramatic efficiencies over manual methods while also reducing the risk of errors. RiverSync Maintenance Services can help you maintain a current view of your RiverSync installed base, including device and configuration details such as serial number, product ID, RiverWare Software version, install infrastructure capacity, IP address, hostname, and more.

By providing enhanced visibility into your installed base, RiverSync Maintenance Services allows you to:

- Quickly identify RiverSync products that are reaching end of life, end of sale, or end of support
- Easily see what has been moved, added, or change in your infrastructure.
- Verify that your RiverSync hardware is running current, consistent, and supported software versions.
- Mitigate risk and plan for upgrades for equipment that is no longer supported.

## Capabilities to Enhance and Control Lifecycle Management

Capabilities with the RiverSync Maintenance Services portal can enhance and control product and lifecycle visibility.

- **Device data file uploads:** In addition to data uploads from the RiverWare Collector, data can be uploaded using manual file uploads (such as from a spreadsheet) or third-party collection mechanisms. After data is uploaded into the portal, is can be analyzed and enriched with RiverSync support information.
- **Role-based access control:** The RiverSync Maintenance Services portal gives you control over the types of data that users can see. User views within the portal are based on the user’s role, allowing administrators to assign roles and designate infrastructure equipment data visibility for portal users, including partners. For example, a certain group of infrastructure administrators may be given access to data for a specific segment of the infrastructure and other groups of users may be restricted to specific types of information such as device configuration data or operation alerts.
