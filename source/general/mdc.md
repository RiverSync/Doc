# Micro Data Center

> Self-contained, secured computing environment that includes all computing, memory, storage, networking. They are assembled and tested from the factory environment and shipping in a single enclosure that include all necessary power, cooling, security, and associated management tools.

Micro Data Center are designed to minimize capital outlay, reduce footprint, energy consumption, and increase speed of deployment. Their size, versatility and plug-and-play features make them ideal for use in remote locations, for temporary deployments or even for use by business temporarily in locations that are in high-risk zones for floods or earthquakes.

Micro data center are sprouting up on the edges of networks, whether in the factories, on container ships, and installed at cellular base stations. This is as enterprises and service providers look to embed compute and storage capacity closer to where data is being comsumed.

We cannot say that micro data center as a product category will fit all needs of today IT infrastructure, but we believe that is has huge update potential, not because it creates something completely new but because it will help address challenges and it will meet demand for highly distributed capacity.

The cloud might be trend that enterprise are moving forward toward as it simplify IT requirements to meet at demand, but the desire for localized computing power is increase as companies advance their digital initiatives. Enterprises are fighting bandwidth constraints and trying to shave milliseconds of response times for latency-sensitive applications aka IoT deployments. For industrial environments, companies need local data storage and processing capabilities to make the most of data-centric smart systems. Also, telcos and content distributors are looking to deploy and managed edge-computing solutions more efficiently in response to demand for digital services.

## What is a micro data center?

A micro data center is essentially, an IT facility excapsulated in its own protective shell. Climate controls, power distribution and network connectivity are built into a profabricated unit, along with other features such as physical security, fire suppression, shock adsorption, and protection from electromagnetic interference. this is a response to a problem of deploying small pockets of IT capacity.

## Where does micro data center come in?

Which is the key for optimizing the performance and usefulness of mobile and other networked devices. The idea of a micro data center is to take a standard rack-mount envirment and add capabilities that a standard rack or a converaged system would struggle to provide, creating a self-contained platform where a containerized solution would be too large or expensive for what is needed.

Each system provides a secure enclosure that is self-contained with heat management and insulation, with low-cost energy management. Many have optional extras, such as power supply backup and defence against external fire threats, and fully monitored events, such as any attempt to vandalize the system or to move it from its installed position.

Being based around a standardized 19in rack, these micro data center could house any IT equipment that would normally be found in a rack of a normal data center. However, the idea behind a micro data center is that it should be preconfigured and delivered to carry out specific tasks.

A micro data center can also be a good solution for organization that deal with applications and data required higher levels of security. With the right resources in the rack, data can be air-locked so it remains within the rack except when the right, multi-factor identification factors have been provieded without the need for additional security software being added to the architechture.

Correctly configured micro data center can suit the needs of SMEs that do not have established data center infrastructures.
