# Micro Data Center

> Self-contained, secured computing environment that includes all computing, memory, storage, networking. They are assembled and tested from the factory environment and shipping in a single enclosure that include all necessary power, cooling, security, and associated management tools.

Micro Data Center are designed to minimize capital outlay, reduce footprint, energy consumption, and increase speed of deployment. Their size, versatility and plug-and-play features make them ideal for use in remote locations, for temporary deployments or even for use by business temporarily in locations that are in high-risk zones for floods or earthquakes.

# What is a micro data center?

## Where does micro data center come in?

Which is the key for optimizing the performance and usefulness of mobile and other networked devices. The idea of a micro data center is to take a standard rack-mount envirment and add capabilities that a standard rack or a converaged system would struggle to provide, creating a self-contained platform where a containerized solution would be too large or expensive for what is needed.

Each system provides a secure enclosure that is self-contained with heat management and insulation, with low-cost energy management. Many have optional extras, such as power supply backup and defence against external fire threats, and fully monitored events, such as any attempt to vandalize the system or to move it from its installed position.

Being based around a standardized 19in rack, these micro data center could house any IT equipment that would normally be found in a rack of a normal data center. However, the idea behind a micro data center is that it should be preconfigured and delivered to carry out specific tasks.

A micro data center can also be a good solution for organization that deal with applications and data required higher levels of security. With the right resources in the rack, data can be air-locked so it remains within the rack except when the right, multi-factor identification factors have been provieded without the need for additional security software being added to the architechture.

Correctly configured micro data center can suit the needs of SMEs that do not have established data center infrastructures.
