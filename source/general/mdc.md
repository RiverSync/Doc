# Micro Data Center

> Self-contained, secured computing environment that includes all computing, memory, storage, networking. They are assembled and tested from the factory environment and shipping in a single enclosure that include all necessary [power](general/power/index.html), [cooling](general/cooling/index.html), [security](general/security/index.html), and associated management tools.

Micro Data Center are designed to minimize capital outlay, reduce footprint, [energy consumption](general/power/concumption.html), and increase speed of deployment. Their size, versatility and plug-and-play features make them ideal for use in remote locations, for temporary deployments or even for use by business temporarily in locations that are in high-risk zones for floods or earthquakes.

Micro data center are sprouting up on the edges of networks, whether in the factories, on container ships, and installed at cellular base stations. This is as enterprises and service providers look to embed compute and storage capacity closer to where data is being comsumed.

We cannot say that micro data center as a product category will fit all needs of today IT infrastructure, but we believe that is has huge update potential, not because it creates something completely new but because it will help address challenges and it will meet demand for highly distributed capacity.

The cloud might be trend that enterprise are moving forward toward as it simplify IT requirements to meet at demand, but the desire for localized computing power is increase as companies advance their digital initiatives. Enterprises are fighting bandwidth constraints and trying to shave milliseconds of response times for latency applications aka IoT deployments. For industrial environments, companies need local data storage and processing capabilities to make the most of data-centric smart systems. Also, telcos and content distributors are looking to deploy and managed edge-computing solutions more efficiently in response to demand for digital services.

## What is a micro data center?

A micro data center is essentially, an IT facility excapsulated in its own protective shell. Climate controls, power distribution and network connectivity are built into a profabricated unit, along with other features such as physical security, fire suppression, shock adsorption, and protection from electromagnetic interference. this is a response to a problem of deploying small pockets of IT capacity.

Compact, hardened technical facilites are abundant in the telco industry, and server rooms abound in the branch office landscape. But micro data centers differ from traditional IT outposts. On a product level, these are much more hightly engineered and integrated than the typical IT closet or server room.

Performance is part of the appeal. As companies consider the infrastructure requirements of a decentralized approach to IT, they are finding their existing distributed capacity in many cases needs to be decommissioned or upgraded. Most existing sites are not nearly adequate and suited for digital services. They don't have the robustness, resilience, protection.

Another distinction of micro data centers is the ease of deployment. Testing and integration of micro data center components is done by the vendor and its channel partners, which speeds the deployment timeline. Because the units are [prefabricated](general/prefabricated/index.html) and self-contained, there is less site work that must be done. That is particularly appealing for the financial services industry. Banks, for example, appreciate the control and predictability of micro data centers. They love the fact that these things can be tested and stacked and locked down in a factory environment and then shipped with armed guards to a site and deployed. That is so much simpler a project a project than supervising on-site contractors working for weeks, building or creating a room or a network closed.

The decision to deploy micro data centers will be deliberate, another characteristic that distinguishes micro data center from typical IT closet and server room builds. With micro data center deployment, we think is going to be less accidental or tactical. It will be more strategic and well planned as part of a bigger achitecture.

## Where does micro data center come in?

Which is the key for optimizing the performance and usefulness of mobile and other networked devices. The idea of a micro data center is to take a standard rack-mount environment and add capabilities that a standard rack or a converaged system would struggle to provide, creating a self-contained platform where a containerized solution would be too large or expensive for what is needed.

Each system provides a secure enclosure that is self-contained with heat management and insulation, with low-cost energy management. Many have optional extras, such as power supply backup and defence against external fire threats, and fully monitored events, such as any attempt to vandalize the system or to move it from its installed position.

Being based around a standardized 19in rack, these micro data center could house any IT equipment that would normally be found in a rack of a normal data center. However, the idea behind a micro data center is that it should be preconfigured and delivered to carry out specific tasks.

A micro data center can also be a good solution for organization that deal with applications and data required higher levels of security. With the right resources in the rack, data can be air-locked so it remains within the rack except when the right, multi-factor identification factors have been provieded without the need for additional security software being added to the architechture.

Correctly configured micro data center can suit the needs of SMEs that do not have established data center infrastructures.


## Gain flexibility

A Company without a physical data center could use a self-contained micro data center to gain the flexibility of having multiple servers, along with required storage and networking, in a single unit that can be positioned pretty much anywhere in its building. Even where and organization is looking at using co-location facility, the extra security and disaster-proofing that a micro data center can offer might be worth looking into.

In a world where it is getting increasingly difficult to pick the right mix of physical and virtual platforms for your business needs, micro data center may be seen a just another tool in the box. However, they make sense for specific types of workload and for specific types of environment.

Micro data center may not come into play too much for large enterprise overhauling their big facilities, but they are more suitable for SMEs without data center, or for a big enterprise's remote branch that is located in a developing, netual disaster prone area.

The age of build your own, based on racks with self-assembled computer, storage and network components, is well on the way out. Prefabricated data centers, along with the use of external cloud based systems, is the future. The key is to ensure that data center professionals choose the right mix.
